> 日本語: [README.ja.md](README.ja.md)

A lightweight Markdown / config-file viewer. Open a folder, pick a file from the
tree, and view Markdown with GitHub-equivalent rendering or config files
(JSON / YAML / TOML family) as a collapsible hierarchical tree.

## Features

- **Two-column UI**: file tree on the left (folder hierarchy, lazy-loaded), viewer on the right.
- **Markdown rendering**
  - GitHub-flavored Markdown (tables, `:emoji:`, GFM alerts `> [!NOTE]`, …)
  - Code-block syntax highlighting (Shiki / github-light · github-dark) with copy
  - mermaid diagrams (copy as PNG / SVG)
  - Table of contents (outline with scroll-spy)
  - Preview / source toggle (source view has line numbers)
- **Config files** (json / jsonc / json5 / jsonl / ndjson / yaml / yml / toml)
  - Collapsible tree (expand/collapse all, tree/source toggle)
  - On a syntax error, switches to the source view and highlights the offending line
- **Standalone mermaid files** (.mmd / .mermaid)
- **Live reload**: edits to the open file are detected and re-rendered automatically
  (scroll position preserved); the tree follows changes too.
- **Open in editor**: detects and launches VS Code / Zed / CotEditor / mi (macOS),
  Notepad++ / Sakura (Windows), etc. Can also reveal the file in the OS file manager.
- **Themes**: light / dark / auto + Solarized Light/Dark · Dracula · Nord.
- **Persisted settings / session restore**: theme, explorer width and side, the last
  opened folder/file, and window geometry are saved and restored on the next launch.

## Tech stack

- [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) (Rust backend + OS-native WebView)
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- SCSS (no Tailwind)
- markdown-it + @shikijs/markdown-it + mermaid + markdown-it-emoji / -github-alerts / -anchor
- Config parsing: yaml / smol-toml / jsonc-parser / json5

## Security

mallow is meant to open **untrusted** Markdown safely, so rendering has a clear
boundary:

- **No raw HTML.** markdown-it runs with `html: false`, so a literal `<script>`
  or `<img onerror=…>` in a document is shown as text, never executed. URL schemes
  markdown-it deems dangerous (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, non-image
  `data:`) are dropped from links. Only `http(s)` links open (in the OS browser);
  in-page `#anchors` scroll, and any other scheme is inert.
- **mermaid** runs with `securityLevel: 'strict'` — sanitized SVG, no click
  bindings or embedded script in diagrams.
- **Content Security Policy** (in `tauri.conf.json`) is the second layer: scripts
  are limited to the bundled app code (`'self'` plus `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` for the
  Shiki highlighter). `'unsafe-inline'` is not allowed in `script-src`, so injected
  inline scripts and event handlers cannot run even if they reached the DOM.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev      # run in dev (hot reload)
pnpm tauri build    # release build (produces .app / .dmg, etc.)
pnpm build          # frontend type-check + bundle only
pnpm test           # frontend unit tests (Vitest)
cargo test          # Rust unit tests (run inside src-tauri/)

# Regenerate the app icons from the master image
pnpm tauri icon src-tauri/icons/app-icon.png
```

## Layout

```
src/                Frontend (React + TS)
  components/        Explorer / Viewer / MarkdownView / ConfigView / SourceView / ...
  lib/              markdown, shiki, mermaid, config-parse, frontmatter, watch, settings, theme ...
  hooks/useFileTree  Centralized file-tree state (lazy load, refresh, expansion)
  styles/           SCSS (_vars / global / app / markdown / config / source)
src-tauri/          Rust backend
  src/commands.rs   read_dir_tree / read_file / path_exists (std::fs)
  src/watch.rs      Recursive file watching via notify (emits the fs:change event)
  src/editors.rs    Editor detection / launch / reveal in OS
  icons/app-icon.png  Icon master (input for regeneration)
```
