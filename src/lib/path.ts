 *  drive letters and `\\server\share` UNC prefixes. These helpers understand
 *  both so tree expansion and the Explorer root label stay correct everywhere.
 *
 *  Kept intentionally tiny: Node's `path` is not available in the WebView, and
 *  we avoid adding an npm dependency for what is a handful of string ops. */
