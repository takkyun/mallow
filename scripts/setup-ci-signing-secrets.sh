# Register the GitHub Actions secrets that .github/workflows/release.yml needs
# to sign + notarize macOS builds in CI. The Apple account values (APPLE_ID /
# APPLE_PASSWORD / APPLE_TEAM_ID) are read from .env.signing; the certificate
# comes from a password-protected .p12 you export from Keychain Access, and
# APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY is derived from that .p12's certificate common name.
#
# Deriving the identity from the .p12 (rather than copying .env.signing's
# APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY) is deliberate: local signing accepts a SHA-1 hash as
# the identity, but tauri-action in CI string-matches the imported certificate's
# common name against APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY — a hash there fails the build.
# No secret value is printed — each is piped straight into `gh secret set`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-ci-signing-secrets.sh path/to/DeveloperID.p12
#
# Export the certificate first: Keychain Access > login > My Certificates >
# "Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)" > right-click > Export…, save as
# a .p12 and set an export password (you'll type it below).
#
# Prerequisites: `gh` authenticated for this repo (`gh auth status`) and a
# filled-in .env.signing (see .env.signing.example).
